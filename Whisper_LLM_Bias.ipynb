        "# Investigating Language Model Bias in Whisper (small) ASR Model\n",

        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "OpenAI's neural automatic speech recognition (ASR) model, Whisper, leverages both ASR technology to transcribe speech and, crucially, an integrated Transformer-based language model to enhance context-based accuracy. This complex, layered architecture has enabled the model to achieve very high transcription accuracy. However, to what extent does Whisper rely on its language model component over its ASR component? To investigate this, I aim to measure perplexity in Whisper to explore whether the model relies more on semantic relatedness when performing ASR tasks, as opposed to the pure phonological information of the acoustic signal.\n",
        "\n",
        "To evaluate whether large language models (LLMs) generate language in a way that parallels human processing—and to further the conversation regarding the role of statistical learning in human language acquisition—previous studies have sought to align LLM behavior with physiological responses to language. For example, EEG research has shown that when individuals encounter unexpected word endings in highly constrained sentence contexts, they exhibit the N400 effect, a negative-going event-related potential (ERP) component associated with semantic processing in response to written and spoken linguistic stimuli. **[cite Kutas paper]**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since human predictability judgements are reflected in the N400 effect, measuring perplexity in an LLM sufficiently operationalizes this phenomenon. Perplexity measures the model's uncertainty when predicting linguistic input, allowing us to assess how strongly the model biases predictability over purely acoustic analysis. Prior research suggests that LLMs exhibit behavior analogous to the N400 effect when encountering unexpected linguistic input, as reflected in increased perplexity **[cite a paper]**. By analyzing perplexity in Whisper’s transcriptions, the current study aims to determine whether its language model component exhibits a systematic bias toward more statistically probable sentences, potentially overriding the acoustic information of the speech input.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, I aim to compare perplexity scores from Whisper-small transcriptions. I examine five different auditory conditions: (1) expected, (2) phonologically-related, (3) semantically-related, (4) both phonologically- and semantically-related, and (5) neither. Below is an example set of stimuli.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The farmer milked the **cow**. (expected, most probable)\n",
        "\n",
        "2. The farmer milked the **couch**. (phonologically-related, improbable)\n",
        "\n",
        "3. The farmer milked the **goat**. (semantically-related, probable)\n",
        "\n",
        "4. The farmer milked the **calf**. (phonologically- and semantically-related, less probable)\n",
        "\n",
        "5. The farmer milked the **rock**. (neither, improbable)\n",
        "\n",
        "If Whisper-small exhibits a bias on its language model component, I should see that lower perplexity is assigned to the semantically-related conditions. More specifically, the perplexity associated with each condition will rank as the following, from lowest perplexity to highest perplexity: condition 1 (expected) < condition 3 (semantically-related) < condition 4 (both semantically- and phonologically-related) < condition 2 (phonologically-related) < condition 5 (neither).\n"

        "The stimuli consists of 8 sets of sentences. Each set contains five sentences where the final word has been manipulated according to the experimental conditions: 1) expected, (2) phonologically-related, (3) semantically-related, (4) both phonologically- and semantically-related, and (5) neither. In total, 40 sentences were generated using ChatGPT.\n",
        "\n",
        "The sentences were then fed into the [ElevenLabs](elevenlabs.io) text-to-speech voice generator in effort to standardize the speaker and minimize noise. The auditory stimuli was generated using the Eleven Multiligual v2 model using the \"Rachel\" voice. Speaker speed was fixed at 1x speed. Stability, similarity, and style exaggeration were fixed at 50%. The generated audio files were saved as mp3 files.\n",
